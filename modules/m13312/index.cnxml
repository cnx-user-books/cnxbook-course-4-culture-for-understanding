			<para id="para_N67351"> Multiculturalism is about recognizing and

			<para id="para_N67362">Some discuss multicultural education as a shift in
				curriculum, perhaps as simple as adding new and diverse materials and
				perspectives to be more inclusive of traditionally underrepresented
				groups. Others talk about classroom climate issues or teaching styles that
				serve certain groups while presenting barriers for others. Still others
				focus on institutional and systemic issues such as tracking, standardized
				testing, or funding discrepancies. Some go farther still, insisting on
				education change as part of a larger societal transformation in which we
				more closely explore and criticize the oppressive foundations of society
				and how education serves to maintain the status quo - foundations such as
				white supremacy, capitalism, global socioeconomic situations, and
				exploitation. </para>

			<para id="para_N67444">Every child comes to school with an ethnic identity
				whether these identifications are conscious or unconscious. This
				identification must be recognized and respected by the teacher. It must be
				the basis for the learning activities in the classroom. This recognition of
				individual ethnic identities is the beginning point; it is a connector of
				both the teacher to the student and the students to each other. It is the basic
				building block in the learning process, which requires knowing where the
				child is relative to him/herself and the content to be addressed. This
				ethnic identification is a continual point of focus throughout the
				education process and is the basis for developing the next level of
				identification, which is a national identification. </para>
			<para id="para_N67446"> The national identity of the individual requires
				his/her understanding and commitment to the democratic ideals such as
				human dignity, justice and equality. Here the focus is on becoming
				effective members of a democratic society. An individual's strong
				national identification is essential to his/her development of a global
				identity. </para>
			<para id="para_N67448"> As our society becomes more and more dependent on other
				societies, it is critical that the schools address the problems of the world
				as a whole. The development of the global identification provides the
				students with the opportunity to see how as a nation we fit into the world
				society. It allows students to better understand that the actions of a
				nation must not only be viewed in terms of the implications for that nation,
				but in terms of its effects on the whole world. Children who have developed
				both a strong ethnic and national identity can also develop a global
				identification, which should in turn make them better citizens of the world
				community. </para>
			<para id="para_N67450"> At this point in time in history, it is important to
				realize that the identifications discussed above are hierarchial. In
				other words, the curriculum and the learning needs to proceed by first
				recognizing the ethnic identity, then the national identity, and finally
				the global. The development of the latter national and global identities
				are dependent upon the development of the former ethnic. It is also
				important to note that the individual identities are not static, but
				continually evolving, and so it is important for the curriculum to
				emphasize all three types of identities as learning progresses. </para>

			<title>Classroom Exercise and Practice</title>
			
			<para id="para_N67742">
				
			</para>
			<para id="para_N67747"> This activity has several steps. (Different
				combinations of these steps will be suitable for different audiences from
				elementary-school students to teachers.) Here are the steps to follow:
				</para>
			<para id="para_N67749"> 1.
				<emphasis>Defining "Multicultural" - </emphasis>Start by underlining
				the prefix "multi" and ask your students what this prefix means. Responses
				will include "many," "varied or various," "different," etc. Affirm all
				answers, and then sum them up. This portion should take only a couple of
				minutes. Next, move on to "cultural." What does this term mean? Encourage
				students to define "cultural" both in terms of a dictionary-type
				definition
				<emphasis>and</emphasis> what it means to them individually. </para>
			<para id="para_N67757"> 2.
				<emphasis>Drawing Out the Dimensions of "cultural" -</emphasis> Tell the
				students you would like them to explore the understanding of "cultural"
				more deeply. Ask them to suggest all dimensions of culture they can think of,
				encouraging them to reflect on their own culture and the dimensions of that
				culture with which they identify. There are several effective ways of
				accomplishing this task. You can either have students call out these
				aspects of culture when they think of them (perhaps even using a student
				volunteer to list them under "MULTICULTURAL." You might also decide to
				simply go around the room, person by person, asking for suggestions.
				</para>
			<para id="para_N67762"> There are literally endless dimensions to culture,
				and this will be reflected in the answers. It is likely that an influx of
				answers will come right away, but then the rate of response will slow down
				considerably. This often happens after some of the more surface-level
				cultural aspects are suggested such as music, food, etc. Prod the students
				to think a little more deeply about how they define their culture. Allow for
				some short silences, or suggest some deeper dimensions, including faith,
				religion, values, language, family structure, and others. </para>
			<para id="para_N67764"> It will be important to get as many suggestions for this
				list as possible. Be sure to note that this part of the activity could go on
				indefinitely, highlighting the complexity of "culture." Also, point out
				how intertwined some of the dimensions are, illustrating how simplistic it
				is to make a judgment about somebody based on one cultural dimension of the
				person. This step should take 10-15 minutes. </para>
			<para id="para_N67766"> 3.
				<emphasis>What's Missing? </emphasis>In our experience, 4 out of 5 times
				this activity is used, several interesting cultural dimensions are not
				mentioned by participants. Ironically, these are the very dimensions that
				are most often associated with multicultural education: race, gender,
				sexual orientation, social class. If your class or workshop does not
				suggest one or more of these items, point this out only
				<emphasis>after </emphasis> the list has been generated and ask the
				participants why they didn't think of these dimensions. It is often the case
				that when participants are suggesting items for the list from their own
				experience, and thus through how they define themselves, identifiers such
				as race, gender, etc. do not come directly to their minds. But, if they are
				suggesting items for the list based on how OTHERS define them, or how they
				define OTHERS, these items immediately come to mind. </para>
			<para id="para_N67774"> 4.
				<emphasis>Categorizing List Items</emphasis> - The next step is to divide
				the items into categories, which will make the final step of the exercise
				much easier. Indicate this intention to the group, and mention that you will
				be using Nitza Hidalgo's "three levels of culture." (The citation for this
				model is: Hidalgo, N. (1993). Multicultural teacher introspection. In
				Perry, T., and Fraser, J. (Eds.), Freedom's plow: Teaching in the
				multicultural classroom. New York: Routledge.) </para>
			<para id="para_N67779"> Hidalgo's
				<term>3 levels</term> include: </para>
			<para id="para_N67784"> a. The Concrete - This is the most visible and tangible
				level of culture, and includes the most surface-level dimensions such as
				clothes, music, food, games, etc. These aspects of culture are often those
				that provide the focus for multicultural "festivals" or "celebrations."
				</para>
			<para id="para_N67786"> b. The Behavioral - This level of culture clarifies how
				we define our social roles, the language(s) we speak, and our approaches to
				nonverbal communication. The Behavioral level REFLECTS our values.
				Aspects to be listed in this category include language, gender roles,
				family structure, political affiliation, and other items that situate us
				organizationally in society. </para>
			<para id="para_N67788"> c. The Symbolic - This level of culture includes our
				values and beliefs. It can be abstract, but it is most often the key to how
				individuals define themselves. It includes value systems, customs,
				spirituality, religion, worldview, beliefs, mores, etc. </para>
			<para id="para_N67790"> Write short definitions for these levels on the board
				or sheet of paper you used to record the dimensions of culture. Review each of
				the categories for a couple of minutes. Give the participants an
				opportunity to consider how they define themselves within these
				categories. Ask them to look over the categories and the items on the board
				for a few seconds. As a group, categorize all items into these categories.
				There may be some disagreement about where a certain item falls, so allow the
				same item to be listed under two categories. </para>

			<para id="para_N67809">
				
			</para>
			<para id="para_N67840"> 5.
				<emphasis>Consistency in Conceptualization -</emphasis> After you have
				categorized, the next step is to facilitate a discussion about
				relatedness, importance, and the consistency of how individuals define
				themselves and others. </para>
			<para id="para_N67845"> Starting with "the Concrete," proceed down the list of
				Hidalgo's categories, asking participants to raise their hands if they
				consider the items listed under that category to be the most important
				dimensions in how they define their own culture. Count the responses to
				each, and list them next to the category name on the board or paper. Be very
				clear that they are indicating what they consider to be important items for
				defining themselves, not the ways in which other people define them. Then,
				do the same for the other two categories (Behavioral and Symbolic). </para>
			<para id="para_N67847"> Now, ask each student to write down the name of the
				category (Concrete, Behavioral or Symbolic) they feel closest to in terms
				of their own self-definition. Sometimes, one or two students will choose
				"the Concrete" or "the Behavioral," but in virtually every case, a vast
				majority of the participants will choose "the Symbolic." As you discuss
				each category, ask those who chose it to describe why they did so, and
				encourage those who did not choose it to explain why. Because most people
				will choose "the Symbolic," be sure to challenge them on why that is more
				important than the other levels. </para>
			<para id="para_N67849">
				<emphasis>After encouraging the participants to convince you that "the
					Symbolic" is the most important category, refer them back to the lists.
					Several questions will lead to interesting conversations:
					</emphasis>When you meet somebody, which of those items (under any of
				the categories) do you use to understand them culturally? Is your attempt to
				understand others culturally consistent with how you want to be viewed and
				understood? What forces in our society might contribute to our
				simplification of the culture of others, even though we don't want to be
				defined simplistically ourselves? </para>
			<para id="para_N67854"> 6.
				<emphasis>Alternative Consistency in Conceptualization for Groups of
					Educators</emphasis>. After recording how many participants define
				themselves most closely with the three categories, and facilitating the
				"why" discussion described above, turn to a conversation about education.
				Which of these categories do you, as an educator, focus on when you are trying
				to teach multiculturally? (This question will provide an "aha" moment for a
				lot of participants. Allow a few moments for that to happen.) How has
				education generally tried to be "multicultural"? What are the aspects or
				dimensions of culture that we focus on in our classrooms when trying to be
				"multicultural"? Is this consistent with how we know people want to be
				defined? </para>
			<para id="para_N67859"> This is especially powerful if you know that a certain
				school is stuck in the "additive" or "heroes and holidays" stage of
				multicultural development. Many schools have a multicultural festival or
				fair, and refer to that as "multicultural education." </para>
			<para id="para_N67861"> 7.
				<emphasis>Wrapping Up</emphasis>. To wrap up this exercise, you can lead a
				discussion on how the participants might try to make their
				conceptualizations more consistent. Point out that this exercise is not
				meant to indict anyone, but rather to highlight how forces ranging from the
				media to our own education can sometimes move us backward when we think we are
				experiencing progress in self and social development. The conversations
				that happen as a result of this activity can last 10 minutes or over an hour,
				depending on what questions you ask and what direction you take. </para>

			</para>
			<para id="para_N67914"> As with the rest of these activities, it is vital in both
				the short run and the long run to validate the views of the participants. If
				they prefer to define themselves at the Concrete or the Behavioral level, do
				not challenge them directly about that. (This may happen with some younger
				participant groups.) This activity can make some participants feel
				vulnerable, and it is important not to intensify that to the point that they
				are no longer participating. </para>
			<para id="para_N67916"> This activity has been especially valuable and
				successful with groups of pre-service or active teachers because it helps
				to clarify multicultural education. Remember, there are a multitude of
				books on multicultural education out there that still present it as an
				additive approach or multicultural festival. This activity challenges
				educators to rethink such a simplification and their own "multicultural"
				teaching practices.
				</para>
			<para id="para_N67918"> This activity also provides an excellent opportunity
				to weave in the idea of the link between teaching well and multicultural
				teaching practices. The various steps bring out the diversity of cultural
				dimensions, just within the room of folks you are working with. This
				illustrates how the most important multicultural education resources are
				students themselves. Instead of trying to define what is culturally
				important to them through special celebrations or additive techniques, it
				is our responsibility to draw them into the conversation, allow them to
				define themselves, and use that as a starting point in the development of
				multicultural education. </para>

				voices and perspectives to successfully address issues that arise around
				race, gender, culture, sexual orientation, or any other identity
				dimension. They will also begin to better understand the collaborative
				process and how they tend to participate in it. This activity can also be a

				the cases or case studies. </para>

				<term>Preparation</term>
			</para>
			<para id="para_N68423"> The first step in preparing for this activity is
				finding one or more cases or case studies about specific instances of
				cultural conflict in schools. These cases can come from news reports, film
				clips, or any other media that details the specifics of a particular
				incident or series of incidents in a school setting. Another excellent
				source for cases is a collection of the personal experiences of your
				students. Consider having each student bring a short write-up of a cultural
				conflict they experienced or witnessed at a school, especially if it was not
				resolved successfully. Whatever source you choose, make sure every
				participant has read, watched, or otherwise become familiar with the case.

				wish to consider the following: </para>
			<list id="list_N68482" list-type="enumerated">
				<item> Go through the model slowly, step by step, using the questions
					accompanying each step to prod the students along. The goal is to be as
					inclusive as possible, and to make sure responses for each step come
					from a diversity of students. When disagreement develops, allow some
					dialogue, but send the message that the central point is that different
					voices inform everyone's understanding. The early steps are not about
					agreeing, but about getting all possibilities and ideas out on the
					table for consideration. Record all responses on a chalkboard, dry
					erase board, or any other resource that will allow all participants to
					closely watch the development of the model. It is essential to show how
					this process is cumulative. Each step in the model builds off all steps
					of the process leading to it. </item>
				<item> For the Conflict Identification step, allow people to identify
					varied central issues. This will likely result in a good opportunity to
					point out how our own cultural experiences, biases, and assumptions
					inform how we see every situation. </item>
				<item> For the Perspectives part, encourage participants to think beyond
					the people specifically named or shown in a particular case. Who else is
					involved? Encourage them to think about the surrounding community and
					observers, and others who may not be obvious initially. This is an
					important step to show how conflicts around differences are sometimes
					symptoms of bigger issues that involve the entire community, even if
					this conflict has presented itself as an incident between two people.
					</item>
				<item> You might consider splitting the Challenges and Opportunities
					section into two parts by discussing one at a time. Be sure to challenge
					participants to think beyond the challenges and opportunities for the
					individuals directly involved in the conflict. Many conflicts,
					especially those that involve controversial topics, pose challenges
					and lead to opportunities at an institutional level. With this in mind,
					Challenges and Opportunitites should be discussed in the context of
					all perspectives discussed in the previous step. </item>
				<item> The Strategies step should be a quick brainstorming process. This is
					not the place for people to critique each other's strategies; instead,
					it's an opportunity for everyone to have their ideas heard and added to
					the list. Strategies should be informed by Perspectives as well as
					Challenges and Opportunities in that they should spring from a desire
					to maximize educational opportunities and the extent to which they
					make sense in the context of the challenges posed by the institutional
					nature of the relevant issues for everyone involved. </item>
				<item> The Solutions section involves collaboratively and
					systematically working through the Strategies with the goal of
					verbalizing two or three specific ways to address the conflict. These
					strategies should be specific and practical. Encourage students to
					think "outside of the box" so that they are not constrained by existing
					ways of addressing issues. Consideration of the Perspectives step and
					the Challenges and Opportunities step should intensify during
					Solutions. </item>
				<item> Expected Outcomes represent what the group expects or hopes will
					result from the Solutions. </item>
				<item> After stepping through the model, it will be important to reflect
					upon the experience. There may be some frustration or anger on the part
					of students whose ideas were not ultimately chosen for the Solutions
					step by the group. Several important questions can be raised: </item>
			</list>
			<list id="list_N68499">
				<item> How was the process of addressing this case through a collaborative
					process different from your previous experiences addressing
					cultural conflict in schools or elsewhere? </item>
				<item> What was the most difficult part of participating in this process?
					</item>
				<item> Were any of your assumptions exposed as a result of the process? If so,
					which ones? </item>
				<item> How are cultural conflicts normally resolved in schools, and to
					whose benefit? </item>
				<item> What are the benefits of assembling a diverse team to address these
					issues? </item>
				<item> Were any ideas or perspectives shared that you would not have
					otherwise considered? </item>

				imagined, or historic) that can serve as a guide for you and your students in
				thinking about multiculturalism. For example, a teacher might introduce
				students to the life and work of Leonardo Da Vinci, a fifteenth-century
				Italian scientist, inventor, and artist. When he pondered a question or
				idea, Da Vinci rarely looked at it from a single perspective. In his
				notebooks, you see sketches of the same flower or a bird's wing drawn from
				several different points of view. </para>
			<para id="para_N69073"> Da Vinci was an
				<emphasis>observer</emphasis>. Da Vinci was a recorder. Da Vinci asked
				questions. Da Vinci was
				<emphasis>curious</emphasis>. Da Vinci was a multi-dimensional learner
				in
				<emphasis>looking at things from several points of view. </emphasis>
				</para>
			<para id="para_N69084"> This ability to look at things from multiple
				perspectives can serve as a guide when looking at and learning to appreciate
				and celebrate cultures. An image works just as well. For example, a quilt has
				distinctive panels (cultural identity), while at the same time those
				panels exist side-by side to make up an entire quilt (humanity).</para>

			<para id="para_N69088">Teachers and students can decide who or what will be the
				guiding mythic figure or image for exploring multiculturalism - either in
				advance or during the course of study as it arises naturally. </para>

				When you finish a section, however, (as you're about to do when you finish
